		<h2>Product Information</h2><br>
		<p>
			<h4>Is Häagen-Dazs gluten free?</h4>
			As a general rule, the gluten in Häagen-Dazs products is present only in the added bakery products, such as cookies, cake, or brownies. We always label the eight major food allergens on our package by their common name. We recommend to always check the label for the most current information before purchasing and/or consuming a product.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h4>What is rBST?</h4>
			rBST is a synthetic hormone given to dairy cows to enhance milk production. We do not source any milk or cream from cows that have been treated with rBST.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Where can I find my favorite Häagen-Dazs® flavor?</h4>
			Go to our flavor finder® page, select a flavor from the drop-down, enter your zip code, and search. We'll show you a list, based on your zip code, of stores that carry the flavor in your area.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h4>What can I do if I can’t find my favorite 200240320042 flavor or new product?</h4>
			We do not control what products stores specifically carry, but we encourage you to talk to your local store manager! You can print, fill out, and bring our product request form making it easy to communicate to your store manager that you’d like to see more 200240320042 products.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Do you pasteurize your fruit ingredients?</h4>
			All our fruit is pasteurized using the high-temp/short-time method, which kills all of the bad bacteria.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Do any of your products contain animal derivatives in gelatin?</h4>
			Eggs and milk are animal-derived, but as two of the eight major allergens, they are always disclosed in the ingredient statement. There may be eggs in some inclusions such as cookie dough, and eggs are sometimes used as a stabilizing ingredient. Aside from the gelatin in the marshmallows and marshmallow variegates, we have no other ingredients that are animal-derived.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h4>What stabilizers do you use in your products?</h4>
			In keeping with our philosophy of using only the purest ingredients, we use only eggs to stabilize Häagen-Dazs®. All our eggs are completely pasteurized.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Does Häagen-Dazs contain real alcohol?</h4>
			Several Häagen-Dazs ice cream products contain alcohol, including our Spirits collection. The alcohol is used as an agent to carry flavor in our super-premium ice cream. Each product contains less than 0.5% alcohol by volume. We recommend to always check the label for the most current information before purchasing and/or consuming a product.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Do you make low-fat or nonfat products?</h4>
			All of the Häagen-Dazs® sorbet products are nonfat.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Do you have more nutrition information?</h4>
			Nutrition information is available on each of the individual flavor pages within the products section. Please check there or the product packaging. For more information, feel free to send us an e-mail.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Do Häagen-Dazs products contain eggs?</h4>
			At Häagen-Dazs, we always label the eight major food allergens, including eggs, on our package by their common name. If an allergen does not appear in the ingredient statement, then it is not contained in the product. We recommend to always check the label for the most current information before purchasing and/or consuming a product.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Does Häagen-Dazs have non-dairy ice cream?</h4>
			Yes, Häagen-Dazs has a variety of non-dairy frozen desserts, including fruit sorbets. Every flavor in our non-dairy collection begins with a core ingredient instead of milk substitutes, resulting in a creamier texture and authentic taste. Explore our full collection of non-dairy products and sorbets.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Is Häagen-Dazs ice cream pasteurized?</h4>
			All Häagen-Dazs raw dairy products (skim milk, whole milk and cream) are pasteurized in our facilities using the high temperature short time (HTST) method. Our eggs are pasteurized at the vendor prior to delivery to our production facilities.
		</P>
		<p>
			<h4>Are Häagen-Dazs products made in a peanut free facility?</h4>
			At Häagen-Dazs, we do not have dedicated peanut or tree nut free lines or facilities. However, precautionary measures are taken to prevent cross contamination. These include: thorough cleaning of our production lines and equipment, and a strict separation of materials that contain the eight allergens.
		</p><br>
		<h2>Product storage and serving</h2><br>
		<p>
			<h4>Product storage and serving</h4>
			Häagen-Dazs® products are best stored at home, unopened, at 0 degrees F (-18 degrees C). For extended storage up to the "best before" date, we recommend -10 degrees F (-23.3 degrees C) or colder, when possible.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h4>How do I know if my Häagen-Dazs® product is at its best quality?</h4>
			When kept at the recommended storage temperature, Häagen-Dazs® products are excellent through the "best before" date found on the package. A "best before" date is found on the bottom of each carton and end flap of the bar packaging.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h4>How should I serve my Häagen-Dazs® products?</h4>
			To deliver the best flavor and texture, allow your Häagen-Dazs® products to soften at room temperature for approximately 10 minutes, depending on the actual room temperature and the temperature of your freezer.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Can Häagen-Dazs® products be refrozen after they've thawed?</h4>
			No. Because we make Häagen-Dazs® products in the most natural way possible, Häagen-Dazs® products should not be refrozen if thawed. Thawing and refreezing can create large ice crystals and cause undesirable grainy/gritty textures or diminished quality.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Are Häagen-Dazs cartons recyclable?</h4>
			Häagen-Dazs containers are not recyclable at this time, but it is the ambition of our parent company, Nestle, to make 100% of our packaging recyclable or re-usable by 2025. We plan to do this through eliminating non-recyclable plastics, encouraging use of plastics that allow for better recycling rates, and working to eliminate or change complicated combinations of packaging materials such as paper/plastics and laminates.
